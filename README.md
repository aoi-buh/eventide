# Eventide

Eventide is a keyboard layout inspired by [dusk](https://github.com/Aorta3698/dusk/tree/main/src) (probably nuked) and kuntum.

## The layout in question

```
b l d w v  f * o u ,
n r t y p  m h a e i
x j k c g  z ' q / .
       s
```

This layout focuses on:
- low sfs
- low sfb
- usability of light magic
- finger loading (and to a lesser extent fspeed)
- low full bigram scissors

in about the same order for impartance.

This layout took inspirations from dusk mainly for thumb alpha, it's focus on low sfs and sfb and kumtum for it's approach in achieving that low sfs.

## Rowstag

`fz` swap for rowstag because I can't reach `f` otherwise.

```
b l d w v  z * o u ,
n r t y p  m h a e i
x j k c g  f ' q / .
       s
```

Has the problem of `fee` and `foo` but I'm too lazy to sort the index.

## Spells

```
rz -> rl
u* -> ue
a* -> oa

I* -> I'm

k* -> ked
ki* -> kid

q' -> qua
qi -> qui
qe -> que
qu -> quo

* -> repeat
```
